### [Coherence](/explanations/c/coherence/)
**The self-consistency and alignment of meaning within structures, fields, and systems**

The quality that makes something "hang together" and resist fragmentation. Coherence is both a mathematical object (the vector field $C_i$ on the semantic manifold) and a lived experience (the sense of things "fitting" together). It is the attractor that resists entropy and the standard by which all transformations are judged.

### [Commit](/explanations/c/commit/)
**A crystallized moment of coherence in the epistemic repository, marking when structure stabilizes around meaning**

Unlike software commits that track code changes, epistemic commits capture the evolution of understanding itself. They are semantic events that preserve not just what changed, but how meaning shifted, deepened, or reorganizedâ€”creating nodes in the recursive memory of the system.

---

### [Constraint](/explanations/c/constraint/)
**A boundary, rule, or structure that stabilizes transformation and enables coherence**

Not to be seen as limitation, but the necessary condition for generativity. Constraints shape the space of possibilities, creating channels through which meaning can flow and stabilize. They are the banks that give a river its direction, the grammar that makes language possible.
