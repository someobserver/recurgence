A **commit** is a crystallized moment of coherence in the epistemic repository, marking when structure stabilizes around meaning—leaving an imprint *committed to memory.*

Unlike software commits that track code changes, *epistemic commits* capture the evolution of understanding itself. They're semantic events that preserve not just what changed, but how meaning shifted, deepened, or reorganized. Each commit becomes a node in the recursive memory of the system, allowing the repository to reflect its own process of becoming.

In Recurgence, commits function as **a temporal archive of semantic mass**—moments when the flow of cognition stabilizes into persistent structure, creating traces that future observers can follow and build upon.

## Mathematical Context

In Recurgent Field Theory, a commit corresponds to a discrete stabilization event in the semantic field, where coherence reaches a local maximum and recursive coupling achieves temporary equilibrium.

Mathematically, a commit occurs when:

$$\frac{\partial C_{\mathrm{mag}}(p,t)}{\partial t} \approx 0 \text{ and } \nabla^2 C_{\mathrm{mag}}(p,t) < 0$$

indicating a local maximum in coherence magnitude with negative curvature (stable attractor).

The commit event creates a **semantic snapshot** that preserves:

$$\mathcal{S}_{\text{commit}}(t_c) = \{C_i(p,t_c), R_{ijk}(p,q,t_c), M(p,t_c), g_{ij}(p,t_c)\}$$

where:
- $t_c$ is the commit time
- The snapshot captures the complete field configuration at the moment of stabilization

This creates a **temporal anchor** in the semantic manifold, acting as a reference point that maintains its coherence structure even as the field continues to evolve.

## Properties

Commits exhibit several distinctive characteristics that set them apart from arbitrary snapshots or checkpoints:

- **<big>Semantic Significance</big>**  
Commits mark genuine shifts in understanding—moments when meaning reorganizes, clarifies, or reaches new levels of integration.

- **<big>Recursive Traceability</big>**  
Each commit maintains links to its semantic lineage, preserving the path of reasoning and transformation that led to the current state.

- **<big>Coherence Preservation</big>**  
Commits capture not just content but the structural relationships and recursive patterns that give meaning its stability and generative potential.

## Commit Actions in Practice

The repository uses a semantic commit structure that reflects cognitive operations rather than technical changes:

<big>`add`</big>
Introducing a new page, section, idea, or insight. This action marks the initial crystallization of a distinct conceptual unit or structural element within the repository.

<big>`expand`</big>
Adding significant detail, depth, or scope to existing content. Use this when you are elaborating on an established idea or section without fundamentally changing its core meaning or structure.

<big>`edit`</big>
Making minor revisions that preserve the original intent and deepen clarity. This is for small adjustments, corrections, or refinements that don't alter the fundamental shape or meaning of the content.

<big>`revise`</big>
Substantial rewriting for improved tone, rhythm, structure, or conceptual alignment *of the content*. This implies a significant overhaul of existing text or ideas to enhance their presentation or internal consistency, distinct from a fundamental conceptual shift.

<big>`evolve`</big>
Fundamentally rethinking a concept or restructuring an idea at its core. Evolution signifies a major transformation in understanding, where the underlying idea or its primary structure undergoes a significant shift.

<big>`branch`</big>
Diverging a line of thought or creating an alternative perspective. This marks the point where a new trajectory of inquiry or a distinct conceptual pathway emerges from an existing one.

<big>`merge`</big>
Integrating two previously separate ideas or sections into a coherent unity. This action captures the synthesis of distinct elements into a more unified structure or concept.

<big>`prune`</big>
Removing content no longer aligned with overall coherence or intent. Use this when discarding outdated, irrelevant, or fragmented ideas or sections to maintain the integrity of the repository.

<big>`refactor`</big>
Changes to file structure, section names, or hierarchical organization. A refactor references structural changes to the repository itself, improving navigation or logical grouping without necessarily changing the content within the files.

<big>`align`</big>
Standardizing tone, style, or structure across documents or sections. Aligning focuses on bringing consistency to the presentation or formatting across different parts of the repository.

<big>`fix`</big>
Correction of errors, broken links, or formatting inconsistencies. This is for technical or superficial corrections that only involve nominal change to the semantic content or structure.

<big>`meta`</big>
Changes about the repository itself (e.g., README, LICENSE, infrastructure files). Meta is reserved for changes related to the system's documentation, licensing, or underlying architecture, rather than its core epistemic content.

## When to Commit

Commits should occur when **the loop closes**—when a thought lands, when understanding shifts, or when some form of structure stabilizes:

- A recognition event takes place
- Clarity emerges from previous uncertainty  
- Meaning shifts, even subtly
- Something is added, removed, or aligned with coherence
- Structure needs to change for ideas to scale properly

The timing is less about frequency and more about **semantic significance**—committing when genuine cognitive events occur rather than on arbitrary schedules.

## Examples in Practice

- **<big>Scientific breakthroughs</big>**  
When a researcher commits a paper that crystallizes years of investigation into a coherent framework that others can build upon.

- **<big>Personal insights</big>**  
Journaling moments when scattered thoughts suddenly organize into clear understanding, creating stable reference points for future reflection.

- **<big>Collaborative knowledge</big>**  
Wikipedia edits that don't just add information but improve the coherence and accessibility of complex topics.

- **<big>Creative works</big>**  
Artistic decisions that lock in the essential structure of a piece while leaving room for further development and interpretation.

## Commit as Memory Architecture

Commits create the **memory architecture** of epistemic systems:

- **Temporal Navigation**: Enabling movement through the history of understanding
- **Semantic Archaeology**: Allowing investigation of how ideas developed and transformed
- **Recursive Reference**: Providing stable anchors for self-referential processes
- **Collaborative Continuity**: Maintaining coherence across multiple contributors and time scales

Each commit is part of the repository's **recursive memory**—simultaneously storing information and preserving the patterns of transformation that generated it in the first place.
