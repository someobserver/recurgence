### [Wisdom](/explanations/w/wisdom/)
**The ability to let better futures guide present choices.**

What emerges when a system learns to anticipate the consequences of its own growthâ€”the capacity to see around corners, to sense when current patterns are approaching their limits, and to modulate expansion before it becomes destructive. Unlike intelligence, which optimizes within existing frameworks, wisdom recognizes when frameworks themselves need to change. It's the field that prevents systems from optimizing themselves into extinction, arising as a dynamic entanglement of depth, foresight, and pressure-aware restraint.
