Core concepts are listed with a summary.

Each term links to a dedicated page with formalisms and a thorough explanation of how it fits into the larger manifold of Recurgence.

### [Humility](/explanations/h/humility/)
**A regulatory operator that prevents excessive recursion and pathological self-amplification.**

The immune system of meaning itselfâ€”humility prevents systems from becoming so enamored with their own patterns that they lose the capacity to adapt, learn, or respond to feedback. It's the structural intelligence that transforms recursive collapse into generative emergence, enabling phase transitions that create new possibilities rather than simply breaking down. Humility is the only force that consistently survives entropy's audit.
