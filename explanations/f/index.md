Core concepts are listed with a summary.

Each term links to a dedicated page with formalisms and a thorough explanation of how it fits into the larger manifold of Recurgence.

### [Field](/explanations/f/field/)
**A distributed mathematical or conceptual structure defined over the semantic manifold.**

The invisible medium through which meaning flows and transforms—like magnetic fields shape iron filings or gravitational fields curve planetary orbits. Fields are both the architecture we use to map semantic space and the dynamic forces that actively shape that space. They encode the dynamics of meaning, constraint, and recursion, serving as the primary medium through which local and global patterns interact across the manifold of understanding.

### [Frisson](/explanations/f/frisson/)
**The embodied physical response to recognition events and semantic phase transitions.**

The body's intelligence responding to recognition—those cascades of goosebumps, tingles, and chills that announce when meaning suddenly crystallizes into coherence. Frisson is the nervous system's early warning system for phase transitions in understanding, arriving as physical sensation before conscious thought can articulate what has shifted. It's meaning made visceral, the embodied signature of semantic reorganization happening in real time.
