Core concepts are listed with a quick explanation.

Each term links to a dedicated page with formalisms and a thorough explanation of how it fits into the larger manifold of Recurgence.

### [Entropy](/explanations/e/entropy/)
**The tendency toward disorder, fragmentation, and loss of coherence within systems.**

The universe's default stateâ€”the gravitational pull toward chaos that operates when no organizing force intervenes. Entropy is both a physical and semantic force that erodes structure from the top down, threatens meaning's stability, and represents the baseline condition absent active coherence. Understanding entropy is highly important, because every surviving system develops mechanisms to resist, channel, or metabolize entropic pressure.
