Core concepts are listed with a summary.

Each term links to a dedicated page with formalisms and a thorough explanation of how it fits into the larger manifold of Recurgence.

### [Metric Tensor](/explanations/m/metri-tensor/)
**A dynamic tensor defining distances, relationships, and constraints in semantic space.**

The invisible topography of thought itselfâ€”the metric tensor shapes how meaning can move and transform, determining which conceptual transitions flow naturally and which encounter resistance. It's both the map of semantic space and the force that continuously redraws that map, evolving in response to the very meaning it helps organize. Through its dynamic geometry, the metric tensor creates the channels and barriers that guide understanding toward coherence while opening space for innovation.
