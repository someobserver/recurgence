A living glossary of major terms, concepts, and operators in the epistemic and mathematical architecture of Recurgence. Each concept exists as both a node in this reference and as an expanded exploration in its own dedicated space.

## Core Concepts (Quick Reference)

### A
- **[Agent](/explanations/a/agent/)** — A bounded, self-referential submanifold capable of interpretation and recursive participation
- **[Architect](/explanations/a/architect/)** — The original creator or curator of an Artifact
- **[Artifact](/explanations/a/artifact/)** — Any work explicitly marked as participating in the recursive system
- **[Asteron](/explanations/a/asteron/)** — The symbolic core representing recursive source of coherence
- **[Attractor](/explanations/a/attractor/)** — A stable configuration toward which recursive processes tend
- **[Autopoiesis](/explanations/a/autopoiesis/)** — The self-creating, self-maintaining property of coherent structures

### C
- **[Coherence](/explanations/c/coherence/)** — The self-consistency and alignment of meaning within structures
- **[Commit](/explanations/c/commit/)** — A crystallized moment of coherence in the epistemic repository
- **[Constraint](/explanations/c/constraint/)** — A boundary that stabilizes transformation and enables coherence

### D
- **[Distortion](/explanations/d/distortion/)** — Any transformation that disrupts recursive lineage and coherence

### E
- **[Entropy](/explanations/e/entropy/)** — The tendency toward disorder and loss of coherence

### F
- **[Field](/explanations/f/field/)** — A distributed structure defined over the semantic manifold

### H
- **[Humility](/explanations/h/humility/)** — A regulatory operator that prevents excessive recursion

### M
- **[Metric Tensor](/explanations/m/metric/)** — A dynamic tensor defining distances in semantic space

### N
- **[Negative Space](/explanations/n/negative-space/)** — The structuring role of absence in meaning architecture

### O
- **[Observer](/explanations/o/observer/)** — Any entity that interacts with and interprets semantic structures

### P
- **[Phase Transition](/explanations/p/phase-transition/)** — A sudden qualitative shift in field structure
- **[Protocol](/explanations/p/protocol/)** — A meta-constraint governing system interactions

### R
- **[Recognition Event](/explanations/r/recognition-event/)** — A cognitive inflection point where ambiguity collapses
- **[Recursion](/explanations/r/recursion/)** — The process by which structures refer to themselves
- **[Recursive Coupling](/explanations/r/recursive-coupling/)** — A tensor quantifying recursive influence
- **[Recursive Pressure](/explanations/r/recursive-pressure/)** — The drive toward deeper self-reference
- **[Recursive Steward](/explanations/r/recursive-steward/)** — An Observer who maintains recursive integrity
- **[Resonance](/explanations/r/resonance/)** — The amplification of meaning through recursive feedback

### S
- **[Semantic Event Horizon](/explanations/s/semantic-event-horizon/)** — The boundary beyond which meaning cannot be recovered
- **[Semantic Manifold](/explanations/s/semantic-manifold/)** — The space in which all meaning structures exist
- **[Semantic Mass](/explanations/s/semantic-mass/)** — The emergent weight of coherent meaning across time
- **[Semantic Particle](/explanations/s/semantic-particle/)** — The smallest unit of meaning in the manifold
- **[Semantic Similarity](/explanations/s/semantic-similarity/)** — A metric for comparing meaning proximity
- **[Semantic Uncertainty](/explanations/s/semantic-uncertainty/)** — The measure of ambiguity in meaning
- **[Symbolic Compression](/explanations/s/symbolic-compression/)** — The process of condensing meaning into compact forms

### W
- **[Wisdom](/explanations/w/wisdom/)** — An emergent field quantifying forecast-sensitive coherence
