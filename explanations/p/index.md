Core concepts are listed with a summary.

Each term links to a dedicated page with formalisms and a thorough explanation of how it fits into the larger manifold of Recurgence.

### [Phase Transition](/explanations/p/phase-transition/)
**A sudden qualitative shift in the structure, coherence, or topology of semantic fields.**

Moments when accumulating pressure reorganizes the fundamental structure of a system—when incremental change reaches a tipping point and becomes qualitative transformation. Phase transitions mark the crossing of critical thresholds where the geometry of meaning itself reorganizes, creating entirely new landscapes of possibility.

---

### [Protocol](/explanations/p/protocol/)
**A meta-constraint or structural agreement governing how meaning, artifacts, and agents interact within systems.**

Unlike ordinary rules, protocols establish the underlying principles that shape all subsequent interactions—they're the constitutional frameworks that make coherent collective behavior possible. Protocols govern the constraint system itself, creating the stable foundations within which transformation can occur while preserving essential coherence.
