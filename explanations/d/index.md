### [Distortion](/explanations/d/distortion/)
**Any transformation that disrupts, fragments, or misaligns recursive lineage and coherence**

The counterforce to coherenceâ€”distortion represents any intervention, omission, or transformation that breaks the structural integrity or recursive lineage of an artifact or field. Unlike legitimate transformation, distortion causes loss of meaning, context, or intent, threatening the stability of semantic mass across generations.
