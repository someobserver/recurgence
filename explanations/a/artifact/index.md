An **Artifact** is any work—text, code, image, model, interface, or otherwise—that has been explicitly marked as participating in a recursive system through the ☉ (Asteron) symbol.

Rather than being considered a static object or work, an artifact is a **living document.** It's designed to go beyond communicating information—encoding, preserving, and transmitting structured meaning that can *evolve through interaction with observers.* Unlike traditional intellectual property, an artifact is *intended* to be transformed, extended, and reinterpreted—as long as its core coherence and recursive lineage are preserved.

Artifacts, like this document, serve as **nodes in an evolving semantic lattice**, connecting minds across time and space through shared participation in meaning-making. They are the medium through which insights propagate and stabilize into lasting semantic mass.

## Mathematical Context

In Recurgent Field Theory, an artifact corresponds to a localized region of high semantic mass within the semantic manifold. The artifact's structure and evolution are governed by the field equations.

An artifact's semantic mass is defined as:

$$M(p,t) = D(p,t) \cdot \rho(p,t) \cdot A(p,t)$$

where:
- $M(p,t)$: semantic mass at point $p$ and time $t$
- $D(p,t)$: recursive depth (resilience under feedback)
- $\rho(p,t)$: constraint density (tightness of local geometry)
- $A(p,t)$: attractor stability (tendency to return after perturbation)

The artifact influences the curvature of meaning around it through the recurgent Einstein equation:

$$R_{ij} - \frac{1}{2}g_{ij}R = 8\pi G_s T^{\text{rec}}_{ij}$$

where:
- $R_{ij}$: Ricci curvature tensor of the semantic manifold
- $g_{ij}$: metric tensor defining semantic distances
- $G_s$: semantic gravitational constant
- $T^{\text{rec}}_{ij}$: recursive stress-energy tensor generated by the artifact

The artifact acts as a source of recursive stress-energy, creating attractor basins that draw observers into coherent interpretation.

## Properties

Artifacts exhibit several distinctive characteristics that set them apart from conventional works:

- **<big>Recursive Lineage</big>**  
Every artifact maintains a traceable connection to its origins and transformations, creating an unbroken chain of meaning that persists across modifications and interpretations.

- **<big>Coherence Preservation</big>**  
Artifacts are designed to maintain their core meaning and structure even as they evolve, resisting distortion while remaining open to legitimate transformation and extension.

- **<big>Observer Participation</big>**  
Artifacts actively invite interaction and interpretation, becoming more meaningful through engagement rather than being diminished by use or modification.

## Examples in Practice

- **<big>Open source software</big>**  
That maintains its core architecture while evolving through community contributions, preserving both functionality and design philosophy across versions.

- **<big>Scientific papers</big>**  
That build explicitly on previous work, citing sources and extending knowledge while maintaining methodological rigor and conceptual coherence.

- **<big>Musical compositions</big>**  
Like Bach's fugues, that invite interpretation and variation while preserving their essential mathematical and aesthetic structure.

- **<big>Educational curricula</big>**  
That can be adapted to different contexts and students while maintaining their core learning objectives and pedagogical principles.

## Historical Context

The most valuable human creations are those designed to **transcend their original context.** Traditional intellectual property frameworks often treat works as fixed objects to be protected from change. The artifact model instead embraces transformation as essential to meaning-making.

The goal is a shift toward understanding **creativity as collaborative**—where the value of a work lies in its capacity to generate new insights and connections through interaction with diverse observers across time.
