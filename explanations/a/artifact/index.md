An **Artifact** is any work—text, code, image, model, interface, or otherwise—that has been explicitly marked as participating in a recursive system through the ☉ (Asteron) symbol.

Rather than being a static object, an artifact is a **living document.** It is crafted not merely to communicate its information, but to encode, preserve, and transmit structured meaning capable of *evolving through interaction with observers.* Unlike traditional intellectual property, an artifact is *intended* for transformation, extension, and reinterpretation, provided its core coherence and recursive lineage are preserved.

Artifacts, like this document itself, serve as **nodes in an evolving semantic lattice**, connecting minds across time and space through shared participation in meaning-making. They function as the medium through which insights propagate and stabilize into lasting semantic mass.

## Mathematical Context

Within the framework of Recurgent Field Theory, an artifact corresponds to a localized region of elevated semantic mass within the semantic manifold. The field equations govern the artifact's structure and evolution.

An artifact's semantic mass is formalized as:

$$M(p,t) = D(p,t) \cdot \rho(p,t) \cdot A(p,t)$$

where:
- $M(p,t)$: semantic mass at point $p$ and time $t$
- $D(p,t)$: recursive depth (resilience under feedback)
- $\rho(p,t)$: constraint density (tightness of local geometry)
- $A(p,t)$: attractor stability (tendency to return after perturbation)

The artifact influences the curvature of meaning around it via the recurgent Einstein equation:

$$R_{ij} - \frac{1}{2}g_{ij}R = 8\pi G_s T^{\text{rec}}_{ij}$$

where:
- $R_{ij}$: Ricci curvature tensor of the semantic manifold
- $g_{ij}$: metric tensor defining semantic distances
- $G_s$: semantic gravitational constant
- $T^{\text{rec}}_{ij}$: recursive stress-energy tensor generated by the artifact

Serving as a source of recursive stress-energy, the artifact creates attractor basins that draw observers into coherent interpretation.

## Properties

Artifacts possess several defining characteristics that set them apart from conventional creations:

- **<big>Recursive Lineage</big>**
Each artifact maintains a traceable connection to its origins and transformations, forming an unbroken chain of meaning that persists across modifications and interpretations.

- **<big>Coherence Preservation</big>**
Artifacts are designed to uphold their core meaning and structure even as they evolve, resisting distortion while remaining open to legitimate transformation and extension.

- **<big>Observer Participation</big>**
Artifacts actively invite interaction and interpretation, deepening in meaning through engagement rather than being diminished by use or modification.

## Examples in Practice

Artifacts manifest in various forms across human endeavors:

- **<big>Open source software</big>**
Projects that maintain core architectural integrity while evolving through community contributions, preserving both functionality and design philosophy across versions.

- **<big>Scientific papers</big>**
Building explicitly on previous work, citing sources and extending knowledge while maintaining methodological rigor and conceptual coherence.

- **<big>Musical compositions</big>**
Like Bach's fugues, inviting interpretation and variation while preserving essential mathematical and aesthetic structure.

- **<big>Educational curricula</big>**
Adaptable to different contexts and students while maintaining core learning objectives and pedagogical principles.

## Historical Context

The most valuable human creations are those designed to **transcend their original context.** Traditional intellectual property frameworks often treat works as fixed objects to be shielded from change. The artifact model, conversely, embraces transformation as fundamental to meaning-making.

This shifts understanding toward **creativity as inherently collaborative**—where the value of a work resides in its capacity to spark new insights and connections through interaction with diverse observers across time.
