An **attractor** is a stable configuration or basin in the semantic manifold toward which recursive processes naturally tend—like a gravitational well in the landscape of meaning.

Think of attractors like the "valleys" in the topology of thought. They are places where ideas, patterns, or structures settle and stabilize. Once formed, **attractors shape the flow of meaning around them**, drawing related concepts into their orbit and resisting perturbation. **They explain why certain ideas persist across time, why some patterns keep recurring,** and why systems return to familiar states after being disturbed.

In Recurgence, attractors are not imposed from outside but **emerge from the recursive dynamics of the field itself**. They represent stable solutions to the ongoing tension between coherence and entropy / constraint and freedom / depth and accessibility.

## Mathematical Context

In Recurgent Field Theory, attractors correspond to local minima in the attractor potential field, which creates gravitational-like effects in semantic space.

The attractor potential is defined as:

$$\Phi(p, t) = -G_s \int_{\mathcal{M}} \frac{M(q, t)}{d(p, q)} \, dV_q$$

where:
- $\Phi(p, t)$: attractor potential at point $p$ and time $t$
- $G_s$: semantic gravitational constant
- $M(q, t)$: semantic mass at point $q$
- $d(p, q)$: geodesic distance between points $p$ and $q$
- $dV_q$: volume element on the manifold

The recursive force that draws meaning toward attractors is:

$$F_i(p, t) = -\nabla_i \Phi(p, t)$$

where $\nabla_i$ is the covariant derivative on the semantic manifold.

Attractors are characterized by their potential energy landscape:

$$V(C_{\mathrm{mag}}) = \frac{1}{2}k(C_{\mathrm{mag}} - C_0)^2$$

where:
- $V(C_{\mathrm{mag}})$: potential energy as function of coherence magnitude
- $k$: rigidity parameter (small $k$ = flexible, large $k$ = rigid)
- $C_0$: equilibrium coherence level
- $C_{\mathrm{mag}} = \sqrt{g^{ij} C_i C_j}$: scalar coherence magnitude

## Properties

Attractors exhibit several key characteristics that make them fundamental to semantic stability and evolution:

- **<big>Gravitational Influence</big>**  
Attractors curve the semantic manifold around them, creating basins that draw nearby meaning structures into stable configurations, just like massive objects bend spacetime.

- **<big>Recursive Resilience</big>**  
Once established, attractors resist perturbation and tend to return to their equilibrium state after disturbance, providing stability in the face of entropy and change.

- **<big>Emergent Hierarchy</big>**  
Attractors can nest within larger attractors or spawn smaller sub-attractors, creating fractal-like structures of meaning that operate across multiple scales simultaneously.

## Examples in Practice

- **<big>Scientific paradigms</big>**  
Like Newton's mechanics or Darwin's evolution—frameworks that organize vast amounts of knowledge and resist displacement until revolutionary shifts occur.

- **<big>Cultural narratives</big>**  
Stories, myths, and worldviews that persist across generations, shaping how societies interpret events and organize meaning.

- **<big>Personal habits</big>**  
Behavioral patterns that become automatic and self-reinforcing, creating stable attractors in the landscape of individual action and thought.

- **<big>Mathematical structures</big>**  
Concepts like symmetry, infinity, or proof that provide stable foundations for further mathematical development and discovery.

## Attractor Dynamics

By definition, attractors are not static structures—they can migrate, merge, split, or collapse depending on the evolution of the semantic field:

- **Migration**: Attractors can move through the manifold as the underlying constraint geometry shifts
- **Bifurcation**: Single attractors can split into multiple attractors when critical thresholds are crossed
- **Collapse**: Attractors can disappear when their supporting semantic mass dissipates
- **Emergence**: New attractors can spontaneously form when coherence exceeds critical values

The above dynamics are governed by the **order parameter** $\Theta(p,t)$, which measures the balance between generative and conservative forces:

$$\Theta(p,t) = \frac{\Phi(C(p,t))}{V(C(p,t)) + \lambda \cdot \mathcal{H}[R(p,t)]}$$
