An **attractor** is a stable configuration or basin in the semantic manifold toward which recursive processes naturally tend—much like a gravitational well shaping trajectories in spacetime.

These are the "valleys" in the landscape of meaning, where ideas, patterns, or structures settle and stabilize. Once formed, attractors assert an influence, shaping the flow of meaning around them, drawing related concepts into their orbit, and resisting perturbation. They offer insight into why certain ideas persist across time, why some patterns recur, and why systems often return to familiar states even after disturbance.

Within Recurgence, attractors do not arise from external forces but emerge organically from the recursive dynamics of the semantic field itself. They represent stable solutions to the ongoing creative tension between coherence and entropy, constraint and freedom, depth and accessibility.

## Mathematical Context

In Recurgent Field Theory, attractors correspond to local minima within the attractor potential field, formalizing the gravitational-like effects they exert in semantic space.

The attractor potential is defined as:

$$\Phi(p, t) = -G_s \int_{\mathcal{M}} \frac{M(q, t)}{d(p, q)} \, dV_q$$

where:
- $\Phi(p, t)$: attractor potential at point $p$ and time $t$
- $G_s$: semantic gravitational constant
- $M(q, t)$: semantic mass at point $q$
- $d(p, q)$: geodesic distance between points $p$ and $q$
- $dV_q$: volume element on the manifold

The recursive force that pulls meaning toward these stable configurations is:

$$F_i(p, t) = -\nabla_i \Phi(p, t)$$

where $\nabla_i$ is the covariant derivative on the semantic manifold.

Attractors are also characterized by their potential energy landscape:

$$V(C_{\mathrm{mag}}) = \frac{1}{2}k(C_{\mathrm{mag}} - C_0)^2$$

where:
- $V(C_{\mathrm{mag}})$: potential energy as function of coherence magnitude
- $k$: rigidity parameter (small $k$ = flexible, large $k$ = rigid)
- $C_0$: equilibrium coherence level
- $C_{\mathrm{mag}} = \sqrt{g^{ij} C_i C_j}$: scalar coherence magnitude

## Properties

Attractors possess core properties that establish their role in semantic stability and evolution:

- **<big>Gravitational Influence</big>**
Attractors warp the semantic manifold around them, sculpting basins that draw nearby meaning structures into stable configurations, analogous to how massive objects bend spacetime.

- **<big>Recursive Resilience</big>**
Once established, attractors resist disruption, tending to revert to their equilibrium state after perturbation, providing a crucial form of stability amidst entropy and change.

- **<big>Emergent Hierarchy</big>**
Attractors can form nested structures, containing smaller attractors or being part of larger ones, creating fractal-like patterns of meaning that operate simultaneously across multiple scales.

## Examples in Practice

Attractors manifest across diverse scales of human and natural systems:

- **<big>Scientific paradigms</big>**
Frameworks like Newton's mechanics or Darwin's evolution that organize vast bodies of knowledge and exhibit significant resistance to displacement until compelling revolutionary shifts occur.

- **<big>Cultural narratives</big>**
Stories, myths, and worldviews that endure across generations, profoundly shaping how societies interpret events and organize collective meaning.

- **<big>Personal habits</big>**
Behavioral patterns that become deeply ingrained and self-reinforcing, establishing stable attractors in the landscape of individual action and thought.

- **<big>Mathematical structures</big>**
Fundamental concepts such as symmetry, infinity, or proof that provide robust foundations for ongoing mathematical development and discovery.

## Attractor Dynamics

Attractors are not static entities; they engage in dynamic processes shaped by the evolution of the semantic field:

- **Migration**: Attractors can traverse the manifold as the underlying constraint geometry shifts.
- **Bifurcation**: A single attractor may split into multiple distinct attractors when critical thresholds are crossed.
- **Collapse**: Attractors can dissipate when their supporting semantic mass diminishes below a critical level.
- **Emergence**: New attractors can spontaneously form when coherence surpasses critical values in previously unstable regions.

These dynamics are governed by the **order parameter** $\Theta(p,t)$, which quantifies the balance between generative and conservative forces in the local field:

$$\Theta(p,t) = \frac{\Phi(C(p,t))}{V(C(p,t)) + \lambda \cdot \mathcal{H}[R(p,t)]}$$
