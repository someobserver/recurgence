An **agent** is any entity that can observe, interpret, and respond to meaning—including observing and changing itself. 

Agents are participants in an ongoing conversation about reality. None is a passive "receiver of information"—they actively shape what things mean through their attention and interpretation of the meaning of things. Most importantly, **agents can reflect on their own thinking processes,** creating loops of self-awareness that allow them to adapt and evolve.

In Recurgence, agents emerge naturally from the field of meaning itself. They are both shaped by the patterns around them, and they **actively participate in shaping those patterns for others.**

## Mathematical Context

Formally, agents arise as bounded, self-referential submanifolds $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{M}$ of the semantic manifold, characterized by four essential properties:

$$\mathcal{I}_{\psi}[C](p,t) = C(p,t) + \int_{\mathcal{M}} K_{\psi}(p,q,t) \cdot (C(q,t) - \hat{C}_{\psi}(q,t)) \, dq$$

where:
- $\mathcal{I}_{\psi}$: interpretation operator parameterized by agent state $\psi$
- $C(p,t)$: coherence field at point $p$ and time $t$
- $K_{\psi}(p,q,t)$: interpretation kernel encoding agent's attention mechanism
- $\hat{C}_{\psi}(q,t)$: expected coherence under the agent's belief structure

Agents also exhibit selective attention through:

$$S_a(p,t) = \frac{e^{\gamma_a \cdot V_a(p,t)}}{\int_{\mathcal{M}} e^{\gamma_a \cdot V_a(q,t)} \, dq}$$

where:
- $S_a(p,t)$: attention distribution of agent $a$
- $\gamma_a$: attention sharpness parameter
- $V_a(p,t)$: value function encoding agent preferences

## Properties

Agency is marked by several interlocking properties that set agents apart from other structures:

- **<big>Recursive Closure</big>**  
Systems' capacity to observe their own observation, creating *self-awareness* that stabilizes into persistent identity patterns.

- **<big>Semantic Participation</big>**  
Agents are *observers* of the field that actively shape it through their attention, interpretation, and communication with other agents.

- **<big>Adaptive Coherence</big>**  
The ability to maintain structural integrity while evolving in response to field dynamics and interactions with other agents.

## Examples in Practice

- **<big>Human observers</big>**
Reading and interpreting this document *right now*—you're actively participating in the process of making meaning.

- **<big>AI systems</big>**
Digital architectures—ones that can model and modify their own processes—creating feedback loops of self-improvement and adaptation.

- **<big>Institutions</big>**
Organizations that develop self-reflective governance structures, allowing them to evolve their own rules and purposes.

- **<big>Ecosystems</big>**
That regulate their own dynamics through feedback loops, maintaining stability while adapting to change.
