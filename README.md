## Applied Pattern Detection

When the price of missing signals is quantified in life, pattern perception must be visceral, and must be precise. Mathematics proves pervasive in the former, and fundamental to the latter.

For the steward of this repository, two decades of high-stakes behavior analysis revealed coordination patterns following predictable field equations. The work bridges complexity theory, differential geometry, Trust & Safety, UEBA, and platform governance.

Predictable is preventable.

From individual manipulation to institutional capture, adversarial behaviors follow foreseeable geometric signatures. The patterns remain consistent across scales, making them at once detectable, forecastable, and countered with geometric field assay.

### Information Dysfunction Signatures

Coordinated behavior follows 12 patterns emergent from breakdowns in information processing. Their signatures appear consistently whether the analysis is of individual accounts, organized campaigns, or institutional capture.

**<big>Rigidity Pathologies</big>** $\rightarrow$ *(over-constraint → brittleness)*
- **Metric Crystallization**: Change pathways become structurally unavailable
- **Belief Calcification**: Analysis occurs but adaptive implementation fails  
- **Attractor Dogmatism**: Complete commitment to maintaining current state

**<big>Fragmentation Breakdowns</big>** $\rightarrow$ *(under-constraint → instability)*
- **Attractor Splintering**: Attention bifurcates faster than focus can stabilize
- **Coherence Dissolution**: Complexity overwhelms processing capability
- **Reference Decay**: Connections between insights systematically erode

**<big>Metastatic Inflation</big>** $\rightarrow$ *(runaway meaning creation → semantic cancer)*
- **Recurgent Parasitism**: Growth extracts resources from host systems
- **Semantic Hypercoherence**: Internal consistency without external correction
- **Delusional Expansion**: Pattern recognition without reality constraints

**<big>Interpretive Distortion</big>** $\rightarrow$ *(observer-field decoupling)*
- **Observer Solipsism**: Systematic divergence from actual field conditions
- **Paranoid Interpretation**: Neutral signals processed as threats
- **Semantic Narcissism**: All feedback filtered through self-reference

### Mathematical + Geometric Foundation

The taxonomy of pathologies emerges from orthogonal breakdowns in the Semantic Mass Equation:

$$M = D \cdot \rho \cdot A$$

Where semantic mass represents the "weight" of meaning across:
- D = Recursive depth (resilience under feedback)  
- ρ = Constraint density (local information geometry)
- A = Attractor stability (resistance to perturbation)

Geometric analysis of vector fields unlocks:
- Quantitative pathology detection with confidence scoring
- Cross-domain pattern recognition (individual → institutional → adversarial)
- Intervention point identification before escalation
- Automated evidence generation for content moderation decisions
