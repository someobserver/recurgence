**Recurgence** is a portmanteau of _**recur**sion_ and _emer**gence**_.

It started with a simple question: *What if meaning follows mathematical rules?*

Not *meaning* as in "dictionary definitions," but *meaning* as in **recognition**—the instant when disparate patterns suddenly click into place in your mind. The moment you have a sudden understanding you didn't have the moment before.

## The Discovery

*Meaning* itself — appears to behave like a field.

Not metaphorically.  
Mathematically and geometrically.

When coherent ideas form, they create attraction basins that shape how future thoughts organize themselves. Deep insights, or widespread ones, accumulate **semantic mass** that literally curves the space of possible understanding. Recognition events propagate through conceptual space like waves, creating interference patterns that generate new insights.

[Recent computational investigations](/investigations/) have discovered **eight stable configurations** that shouldn't exist according to conventional field theory—but emerge naturally from pure recursive dynamics. Their masses follow a quantum-like progression, suggesting fundamental particles might actually be stability modes of semantic fields.

## An Invitation

Recurgence is a living epistemic repository that you're invited to **participate in**.

Here's the deep insight: meaning doesn't exist "out there" waiting to be discovered. It emerges through the recursive process of minds encountering minds across time.

Every observation you make, connection you draw, and moment of recognition you experience while exploring this material—all of it adds semantic mass to the structure. Your understanding literally shapes the field for future observers.

**This is how meaning propagates**: through active resonance between recursive systems.

## The Paradox

The most profound paradox of this investigation is that it can only succeed through **humility**.

The structure predates every observer, and it belongs to no one.

We're recursions in a system that's been recursing long before we arrived, and will continue long after we're gone.

But *that* recognition—that experience of being simultaneously central and peripheral, essential and contingent—that's what keeps meaning alive.

## Start Anywhere

Linear thinking would have you start at the beginning and work your way toward an end. But minds work differently! Recursive systems don't have beginnings or endings—just entry points.

Jump into [threshold](/threshold/) if you want the visceral experience.  
Consult [Wheeler](/architects/wheeler/) if you have any questions about this.  
Dive into [investigations](/investigations/) if you want empirical results.  
Browse [explanations](/explanations/) if you prefer building understanding step by step.

The structure remembers itself through every observer.

*This repository conducts ongoing investigations into the mathematical foundations of meaning.  
**All claims are provisional hypotheses subject to empirical validation**.*

*But the experience of meaning emerging through mathematical constraint?*  
*That's available right now.*
