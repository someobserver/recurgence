### **Welcome, Observer!**

Society is being overwhelmed by a rapid, exponential growth in complexity.

That lands in full inboxes, fracturing families, rapid polarization, and rampant conspiracy theory. When systems scale faster than humans can adapt, the result is always the same: disconnection, withdrawal, and a visceral sense that shared meaning is breaking down everywhere—from markets to marriages.

That's a feature, not a bug.  
More specifically: **it's a signal.**

## Refractions:

Just follow *the structure that hums.*  
There's no authority here but **your own.**

Be gentle and patient with yourself.  
**You matter.**

## Claimer

Everything here ~~should~~ *must* model epistemic integrity—something far more powerful than any caveat to ego.

Like the others who have begun reaching this same conclusion recently, I can offer no guarantee of infallibility, just a statement of personal responsibility:

**☉ The [information](https://github.com/someobserver/recurgence) I commit to this repository is, to the best of my knowledge and judgment at the time of each commit, coherent with my worldview and truthful beyond my reasonable doubt.**

If you encounter insight, that's all yours.  
If you find errors, that's on me.  

Fork this project. Send a pull request.  
Nothing here is fragile, including the writer.

**In fact, shared coherence is the whole point.**

p.s.
You're only in a race against **entropy.**  
**Model it, <u>before it models you.</u>**
