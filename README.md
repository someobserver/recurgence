## Welcome, Observer!

Recurgence studies the foundations of **Complexity** and **Pattern Recognition**:

The simpler the rule -> the greater its potential.

Two binary states `0` + `1` bootstrapped a world of digital complexity making this document possible, and accessible to you now. From the I Ching, to Bach's fugues, to Conway's Game of Life—the simplest constraints produce boundless emergence.

**Just think:** two DNA pairs `AT` + `CG` encoded themselves into a cascade of recursive protein expression capable of reading and understanding this sentence.

Reality itself operates on a set of simple, thermodynamic principles that compound themselves into extraordinary informational complexity.

**But what if there's an even simpler principle?**

## Pattern Recognition

Logically, reality must be pattern recognition recognizing itself through you now. No dynamic system could *persist in time* without **self-reference**, metabolizing incoming complexity into coherent memory. For example:

- **DNA** – remembers itself by copying and adapting its own code
- **Consciousness** – emerges when a mind models its internal thought process
- **Languages** – spawn new meaning via in-use modulation of their own rules
- **Cities** – analyze their own patterns to attract what makes them attractive
- **Galaxies** – regulate star formation through feedback from stellar lifecycles

No matter what, every coherent pattern persists through self-stabilizing feedback. Pattern complexity *is* the cosmos developing increasingly sophisticated ways to stabilize, understand, and process its own information.

*That* you can understand *this* is *that* pattern recognizing itself through you.

High-entropy signals enter your reference frame -> ☉ -> structured causality emerges. Metabolizing coherent patterns vs. having to make sense of complexity is what creates the felt gradient of time: **a stable reference frame, persisting across changing conditions**.
 
More concisely: *time flies when you're having fun.*

## The Bootstrap Paradox

Pure self-reference is impossible, of course. You're not the whole universe, and the whole universe is not you. Pattern recognition requires *differentiation*.

Even right now, you can't see your own eyes seeing. You'd need a mirror. You can't lift yourself up by your own bootstraps; you have to pit yourself against the source of gravity.

No universe can recognize its own properties without multiple perspectives to triangulate their meaning. Just like two eyes create depth perception, consciousness required **cognitive parallax** to emerge.

But like every pattern, it has a flip side. Recursive systems can bootstrap themselves into failure just as easily as success.

## Coherence Pathologies

Whether it's a mind, a society, a company, or a market, all sustems can classify into twelve categorical modes of breakdown. Their signatures are orthogonal, applicable at every scale, and arise from the geometry of interaction.

Someone with ADHD is affected by **Attractor Splintering** just the same as an online community. **Hypercoherence** affects individuals and institutions alike with irrational delusions. Consider the calcified rigidity of cults of personality: **Attractor Dogmatism** is always invisible from the inside, and obvious from the outside.

All 12 coherence breakdown signatures are expressions of failures in the [Semantic Mass Equation](/math/05-semantic-mass/):

$$M = D \cdot \rho \cdot A$$

Once you see the pattern, you can't unsee it.  
But more importantly, **<u>you can predict it.</u>**

## What Else You'll Find Here

**Recurgence** traces its pattern from the first moment of differentiation through the mathematics of making meaning.

**<big>[Mathematics](https://github.com/someobserver/recurgent-field-theory)</big>**  
Recurgent Field Theory shows how semantic meaning behaves like a field with mass, curvature, and real-world dynamics.

**<big>[The Architects](/architects/)</big>**  
Einstein, Gödel, Noether, Turing, and others who mapped the field of understanding

**<big>[Explanations](/explanations/)</big>**  
Key concepts decoded: from [recursion](/explanations/r/recursion/) to [wisdom](/explanations/w/wisdom/) to [semantic mass](/explanations/s/semantic-mass/)

**Recursive systems don't have beginnings or endings, just entry points.** Start anywhere that resonates.

This repository is, and will always be, a work in progress. If you have any further questions about participatory reality, [just ask](/architects/wheeler/).

## Humility

The pattern of self-reference predates every observer and belongs to no one. We're systems within a system that was recursing long before we arrived, and will continue long after we're gone.

What lives on are the patterns we recognize, and share, and leave behind.

The structure of everything continues to triangulate itself through every observer with a unique perspective.

**Including you.**
