## Applied Pattern Detection

When the price of missing signals is quantified in life, pattern perception must be visceral, and must be precise. Mathematics proves pervasive in the former, and fundamental to the latter.

For the steward of this repository, two decades of high-stakes behavior analysis revealed coordination patterns following predictable field equations. The work bridges complexity theory + differential geometry + practicality for Trust & Safety applications + cybersecurity threat modeling + platform governance.

Predictable is preventable.

From individual manipulation to institutional capture, adversarial behaviors follow foreseeable geometric signatures. The patterns remain consistent across scales, making them at once detectable, forecastable, and countered with geometric field assay.

## PRISM: Real-Time Field Analyso.

PRISM (Pathology Recognition in Semantic Manifolds) applies differential geometry to platform interactions, modeling geometric distortions in semantic space. Where legacy tools look for behavioral patterns, PRISM analyzes the field signatures of coordinated manipulation.

The system detects 12 discrete abuse pathologies by treating user interactions as vector fields in a high-dimensional semantic manifold. When coordination occurs, it creates identifiable curvature in this space. Distinct coordination types $\rightarrow$ categorically-quantifiable signatures $=$ patterns recognizing themselves.

The mathematics span scales: Individual bot behavior, organized astroturfing, and nation-state influence alike produce characteristic geometric signatures PRISM can forecast and detect in real-time. Its algorithms detect review fraud, sentiment manipulation, and algorithmic gaming as common expressions of the differential equations describing coherence phenomenology.

Rather than fight every new attack vector in isolation, PRISM unifies the field of abuse detection, recognizing coordination as a geometric property of information itself.

### Information Dysfunction Signatures

Coordinated behavior follows 12 patterns emergent from breakdowns in information processing. Their signatures appear consistently whether the analysis is of individual accounts, organized campaigns, or institutional capture.

**<big>Rigidity Pathologies</big>** $\rightarrow$ *(over-constraint → brittleness)*
- **Metric Crystallization**: Change pathways become structurally unavailable
- **Belief Calcification**: Analysis occurs but adaptive implementation fails  
- **Attractor Dogmatism**: Complete commitment to maintaining current state

**<big>Fragmentation Breakdowns</big>** $\rightarrow$ *(under-constraint → instability)*
- **Attractor Splintering**: Attention bifurcates faster than focus can stabilize
- **Coherence Dissolution**: Complexity overwhelms processing capability
- **Reference Decay**: Connections between insights systematically erode

**<big>Metastatic Inflation</big>** $\rightarrow$ *(runaway meaning creation → semantic cancer)*
- **Recurgent Parasitism**: Growth extracts resources from host systems
- **Semantic Hypercoherence**: Internal consistency without external correction
- **Delusional Expansion**: Pattern recognition without reality constraints

**<big>Interpretive Distortion</big>** $\rightarrow$ *(observer-field decoupling)*
- **Observer Solipsism**: Systematic divergence from actual field conditions
- **Paranoid Interpretation**: Neutral signals processed as threats
- **Semantic Narcissism**: All feedback filtered through self-reference

### Mathematical + Geometric Foundation

The taxonomy of pathologies emerges from orthogonal breakdowns in the Semantic Mass Equation:

$$M = D \cdot \rho \cdot A$$

Where semantic mass represents the "weight" of meaning across:
- D = Recursive depth (resilience under feedback)  
- ρ = Constraint density (local information geometry)
- A = Attractor stability (resistance to perturbation)

Geometric analysis of vector fields unlocks:
- Quantitative pathology detection with confidence scoring
- Cross-domain pattern recognition (individual → institutional → adversarial)
- Intervention point identification before escalation
- Automated evidence generation for content moderation decisions

## Epistemic Intelligence Architecture

CARTA builds a mathematical microscope to study cognitive evolution and the topology of thought. It parses and archives full ChatGPT conversation trees in vector space, preserving their semantic lineage as individual nodes and node-pairs.

Every conversation is an opportunity for counterfactual epistemology. CARTA preserves the complete topology of what was said, *and what could have been said*; why certain paths were abandoned, and where brilliance was ready to crystallize.

The system computes "semantic mass" for various ideas, tracking the gain or loss of epistemic weight over the evolution of the conversation. It identifies generative "spark nodes" of emergent understanding, and cognitive bottlenecks of constrained thinking. Analysis across many conversations reveals patterns in how ideas get explored, get stuck, get free, or fall into fallacy.

CARTA demonstrates why AI systems shape human thinking patterns, where manipulation becomes possible (and inevitable), and how to detect the shift from authentic inquiry to prompted conclusions.

For T&S applications, this understands how influence operations work at the cognitive level. It's never just about what people say, but the totality of the circumstances: how thinking processes can be geometrically manipulated.

And how that can be readily detected.
