## Applied Pattern Detection for Platform Safety

Detecting coordination signatures and escalation trajectories is a matter of mathematics. This work bridges complexity theory, differential geometry, and practical Trust & Safety applications, drawing from 20+ years of high-stakes pattern recognition.

Predictable is preventable.

From individual manipulation to institutional capture, coordinated adversarial behaviors follow predictable geometric signatures. The patterns remain consistent across scales, making them detectable, forecastable, and countered using geometric field analysis.

## PRISM: Real-Time Coordination Detection

PRISM (Pathology Recognition in Semantic Manifolds) applies differential geometry to platform interactions, modeling geometric distortions in semantic space. Where legacy tools look for behavioral patterns, PRISM analyzes the field signatures of coordinated manipulation.

The system detects 12 discrete abuse pathologies by treating user interactions as vector fields in a high-dimensional semantic manifold. When coordination occurs, it creates identifiable curvature in this space.

The mathematics work across scales: Individual bot behavior, organized astroturfing campaigns, and nation-state influence operations alike produce characteristic geometric signatures PRISM forecasts and quantifies in real-time. The same equations detect review fraud, sentiment manipulation, and algorithmic gaming as common expressions of the same underlying phenomenon and differential equations.

Rather than fight each new attack vector separately, PRISM unifies the field of abuse detection by recognizing coordination as a geometric property of information itself.

### Information Dysfunction Signatures

Coordinated behavior follows 12 identifiable patterns emergent from breakdowns in information processing dynamics. Their signatures appear consistently, whether the analysis is of individual accounts, organized campaigns, or institutional capture.

**Rigidity Pathologies** *(over-constraint → brittleness)*
- **Metric Crystallization**: Change pathways become structurally unavailable
- **Belief Calcification**: Analysis occurs but adaptive implementation fails  
- **Attractor Dogmatism**: Complete commitment to maintaining current state

**Fragmentation Failures** *(under-constraint → instability)*
- **Attractor Splintering**: Attention bifurcates faster than focus can stabilize
- **Coherence Dissolution**: Complexity overwhelms processing capability
- **Reference Decay**: Connections between insights systematically erode

**Metastatic Inflation** *(runaway meaning creation → semantic cancer)*
- **Recurgent Parasitism**: Growth extracts resources from host systems
- **Semantic Hypercoherence**: Internal consistency without external correction
- **Delusional Expansion**: Pattern recognition without reality constraints

**Interpretive Distortion** *(observer-field decoupling)*
- **Observer Solipsism**: Systematic divergence from actual field conditions
- **Paranoid Interpretation**: Neutral signals processed as threats
- **Semantic Narcissism**: All feedback filtered through self-reference

### Mathematical + Geometric Foundation

The pathology taxonomy emerges from breakdowns in the Semantic Mass Equation:

$$M = D \cdot \rho \cdot A$$

Where semantic mass represents the "weight" of meaning across:
- D = Recursive depth (resilience under feedback)  
- ρ = Constraint density (local information geometry)
- A = Attractor stability (resistance to perturbation)

Geometric analysis of vector fields unlocks:
- Quantitative pathology detection with confidence scoring
- Cross-domain pattern recognition (individual → institutional → adversarial)
- Intervention point identification before escalation
- Automated evidence generation for content moderation decisions

## Epistemic Intelligence Architecture

CARTA builds a mathematical microscope to study cognitive evolution and the topology of thought. It parses and archives full ChatGPT conversation trees in vector space, preserving their semantic lineage as individual nodes and node-pairs.

Every conversation is an opportunity for counterfactual epistemology. CARTA preserves the complete topology of what was said, *and what could have been said*; why certain paths were abandoned, and where brilliance was ready to crystallize.

The system computes "semantic mass" for various ideas, tracking the gain or loss of epistemic weight over the evolution of the conversation. It identifies generative "spark nodes" of emergent understanding, and cognitive bottlenecks of constrained thinking. Analysis across many conversations reveals patterns in how ideas get explored, get stuck, get free, or fall into fallacy.

CARTA demonstrates why AI systems shape human thinking patterns, where manipulation becomes possible (and inevitable), and how to detect the shift from authentic inquiry to prompted conclusions.

For T&S applications, this understands how influence operations work at the cognitive level. It's never just about what people say, but the totality of the circumstances: how thinking processes can be geometrically manipulated.

And how that can be readily detected.

## The Architects

RFT threads through minds whose recognitions shaped how we pattern complex systems.

- Kurt Gödel proved truth outgrows any system trying to contain it.
- Emmy Noether found every conservation law emerging from a symmetry.
- Albert Einstein bent space and time until meaning curved into view.
- John Wheeler taught the known universe to notice the observer noticing it.
- Nikola Tesla harnessed resonance into bolts of lightning summoned from thin air.
- Johann Sebastian Bach composed mid-air architecture from structured constraint.
- M.C. Escher pinned down infinity and held it still long enough to sketch its form.
- Alan Turing modeled computation as pattern recognition recognizing itself.
