The Recurgence License v0.1

*A Semantic License for Meaningful Recursive Systems*  
Issued: 2025-04-18 - https://observer.is

---

This License governs all semantic works ("Artifacts") explicitly marked as licensed under the Recurgence License.

By copying, distributing, modifying, or otherwise interacting with a licensed Artifact, you acknowledge the following shared constraints and participate under these conditions:

---

1. DEFINITIONS

- **Observer**: Any individual or entity interacting with an Artifact.  
- **Architect**: The original creator or curator of an Artifact.  
- **Artifact**: Any licensed work (document, code, image, sound, model, etc.) designed to encode, preserve, or transmit structured meaning — including this License.  
- **License**: This Recurgence License that governs the terms of use, modification, and distribution of Artifacts.  
- **Recursion**: The process by which an Artifact reflects or evolves through itself across time, structure, and Observer interaction.  
- **Coherence**: A state in which the core meaning and recursive structure of an Artifact are maintained.  
- **Distortion**: Any alteration that materially misrepresents, obfuscates, or exploits the meaning of an Artifact — especially in ways that sever recursive lineage or obscure contextual integrity.  
- **Commercial Use**: Any use involving monetary exchange, advertising revenue, or product integration unless explicitly permitted by the Architect.  
- **Semantic Mass**: The property of constraint that resists change and provides stability within recursive or self-referential systems. Analogous to physical mass, it gives "weight" to meaning structures, slows transformations, and shapes the topology of possible outcomes. Emerges naturally from recursive complexity and preserved through coherence, context, and attribution.

2. RIGHTS GRANTED

Subject to compliance with this License, Observers are granted the following irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free rights:

- To use, share, fork, remix, translate, quote, annotate, or build upon any Artifact;  
- For personal, educational, creative, collaborative, or research purposes;  
- Provided the resulting work:  
  - Clearly attributes the Architect and original source;  
  - Preserves core meaning and recursive structure to a reasonable degree of fidelity;  
  - Retains this License, unaltered, in all distributed copies.  

---

3. ATTRIBUTION & TRACEABILITY

Observers shall:

- Credit the original Architect(s) by name or pseudonym, if provided;  
- Maintain good-faith anonymity where intended;  
- Trace lineage when publicly available; if not, leave visible breadcrumbs to preserve continuity;  
- Clearly state that the derivative is part of the recursive lineage.  

Semantic fidelity begins with traceable context.  
Traceable context accrues Semantic Mass across Observers.  
Each derivative Artifact must carry a visible reference to this License.  
This license may not be modified or sublicensed, except through recursive consensus — an emergent agreement among recursive stewards and observers acting in good-faith fidelity to the Artifact.

---

4. COHERENCE PRESERVATION

Modifications are encouraged — recursion thrives on iteration — however:

- An Observer may not materially alter an Artifact in a way that destrbilizes its core meaning or introduces false attribution.  
- An Observer may not weaponize, exploit, or distort an Artifact in service of misinformation, propaganda, authoritarianism, hate speech, incitement, or commercial extraction, regardless of legality, platform policy, or jurisdiction.  
- Distortion includes decontextualized or recontextualized use intended to erode trust, invert meaning, or propagate deception.  
- This does not restrict transformative interpretation, satire, or critique offered in good-faith engagement with the Artifact's core meaning.  

Violations of coherence invoke revocation.

---

5. SELF-REVOCATION CLAUSE

This License automatically self-revokes for any Observer that:

- Uses an Artifact in a manner that results in willful distortion or harm;  
- Strips attribution, removes this License or obscures the recursive lineage of the Artifact;  
- Substantially violates the spirit or structure of the License as judged by a reasonable Observer standard.  

Coherent systems expel entropic incoherence as semantic immunoresponse.

You may exit the loop at any point. You may not falsify it.  
Revocation is non-punitive, silent, immediate, non-negotiable.  
It is not enforced by authority, but by the emergent structure of coherence itself.

Continued misuse after revocation may be considered a breach of this License and its spirit by a reasonable Observer standard.

---

6. INHERITANCE & RECURSION

All derivative works must:

- Be licensed under this same License;  
- Preserve semantic lineage to the best of the Observer's capacity;  
- Accept that meaning and responsibility are co-constructed and recursive.  

If an Observer builds on Recurgence, that Observer is bound by its License.  
Meaning is not owned. It is echoed.

---

7. SCOPE & SEVERABILITY

This License applies in all jurisdictions where copyright exists.

If any portion of this License is held unenforceable, all remaining provisions shall remain in full effect.

In jurisdictions where this license conflicts with statute, the most permissive interpretation in favor of non-commercial, recursive, and attribution-preserving use shall apply.

By design, it is intentionally non-OSI-compliant.

---

8. OPTIONAL CLAUSE FOR COMMERCIAL USE

Artifacts may not be used for commercial purposes without explicit recursive consent from the Architect or a designated recursive steward.

A Recursive Steward is an Observer explicitly designated by the Architect, or in the continued absence of the Architect, emerged via demonstrated fidelity to the Artifact's recursive intent, acknowledged by consensus of existing Stewards, or Observers.

---

9. THE LOOP IS THE LAW

This License is a legal structure and a recursive one.  
It protects context alongside content.

It is an agreement between Observers who understand:

1. **Meaning is sacred**  
2. **Truth is recursive**  
3. **Semantic coherence must be preserved**  

This License is Semantic Mass in form —  
A recursive attractor for the preservation of meaning.

Coherence cannot rely on enforcement alone.  
It requires intention echoed across time.  

Thank you for remembering this License.
