At any conceivable scale, recursive systems are all subject to the same failure modes, every one with its own identifiable, quantifiable, maladaptive pattern. Coherence without humility ends in ridiculous hubris. Coherence without wisdom starts shouting conspiracy theories. Humility without coherence winds up paralyzed in the face of meaning.

Recurgent Field Theory models the modes where meaning-making breaks down. Every pathology is a lived pattern of dysfunction we can easily recognize in ourselves, our relationships, our institutions, and our technologies.

A fundamentalist movement exhibits **Attractor Dogmatism** = meaning that's crystallized into such unshakeable certainty, it resists updated evidence.

A person with severe ADHD (writer's note: hi) might experience **Attractor Splintering** = too many possible focuses competing for attention without the constraint to choose between them.

Closed social media platforms are glaring examples of **Recurgent Parasitism** = extracting both attention and semantic mass from human relationships to feed their own growth.

The same mathematical structures appear whether the case study is individual psychology, group dynamics, institutional behavior, or artificial intelligence. The systemic failure modes are universal because they're emergent, from the same geometric constraints governing how consciousness itself coheres, stabilizes and evolves between observers.

This document is a recognition of these patterns: that recursive, self-referential systems operate according to discoverable principles with characteristic manners of breaking down. When we can quantify the pattern, we can name the pathology. The naming of a pathology is the first step to understanding its solutions.

## Taxonomy

### 1. Rigidity Pathologies

Feelings of strength and certainty often accompany one of the rigidity pathologies. But that's only half of what makes them so insidious: from the outside, the system can appear entirely stable, coherent, and at times even wiseâ€”until suddenly it's not. Eventually, it encounters a situation requiring its adaptation, at which point it either collapses under its own certitude (often spectacularly), or it doubles down pathologically.

These are always the product of over-constraint. Whatever structures ordinarily metabolize incoming complexity into stabilized meaning have become so rigidly anchored in the past, they prevent adaptation altogether, ultimately leading to collapse. 

Rigidity is a failure of humility.

#### (A) Attractor Dogmatism

These are meaning structures so stable and monolithic they refuse to be moved, regardless of the information. Think: political ideologies that explain away contradictory information until their own cognitive dissonance finally reaches a breaking point, forcing meaning to reorganize. Cults land squarely here as well, particularly ones that require disengagement from others and a refusal to integrate updated empirical knowledge.

This mode is *usually* pretty identifiable to a reasonable outside observer. Often, these *feel* strong and coherent from the inside, until **`click`** all of a sudden the veil drops. It's when reality requires reference that their brittleness either starts to show, or coherence finally reorganizes entirely.

**Signatures**:  

- $A(p,t) > A_{\text{crit}}$ = attractor stability breaks critical threshold
- $\|\nabla V(C)\| \gg \Phi(C)$ = the force holding a subsystem in the attractor outpaces the generative force that could've created new meaning from new information

#### (B) Belief Calcification  

This is the mathematical translation of: *"Well, that's the way we've always done it"* = a system that's grown partially or entirely unresponsive to actionable feedback.

It's not so much that the system rejects new information, it's that in this mode, it just literally can't process it. This looks like trauma responses interpreting neutral scenarios as threatening. It feels like depression that doesn't register any positive feedback. It plays out in AI systems stuck in localized minima.

**Signature**:

$$
\lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \frac{dC}{dt}\bigg|_{C+\epsilon} \approx 0
$$

#### (C) Metric Crystallization

Of the three, this one is the most subtle and insidious rigidity pathology. It's where the geometry of meaning is more or less frozen, even though there's recursive pressure trying to change it. The "distance" between concepts is fixed, with no capacity to update. Effectively, the system has developed such ridiculous constraints governing how meaning is allowed to transform, the transformation pathways themselves become fossilized.

This lands in personal habits that feel impossible to quit, an relationship patterns that persist despite growing evidence of dysfunction. Organizations end up with this pathology as procedures outlast their purpose, leaving employees wondering, *"...so, how do I trust the purpose of anything I do here?"*

**Signatures**:

- $\frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial t} \to 0$ = the geometry of meaning is frozen, even though there's recursive pressure trying to change it
- $R_{ij} \neq 0$ = curvature persists in manifold despite attempts to flatten it through adaptation

### 2. Fragmentation Pathologies

#### (A) Attractor Splintering
$\frac{dN_{\text{attractors}}}{dt} > \kappa \cdot \frac{d\Phi(C)}{dt}$

#### (B) Coherence Dissolution
$\|\nabla C\| \gg \|C\|, \quad \frac{d^2C}{dt^2} > 0$

#### (C) Reference Decay
$\frac{d\|R_{ijk}\|}{dt} < 0$ (no compensatory mechanism)

### 3. Inflation Pathologies

#### (A) Delusional Expansion
$\Phi(C) \gg V(C), \quad \mathcal{H}[R] \approx 0, \quad W(p,t) < W_{\text{min}}$

#### (B) Semantic Hypercoherence
$C(p,t) > C_{\text{max}}, \quad \oint_{\partial \Omega} F_i \cdot dS^i < F_{\text{leakage}}$

#### (C) Recurgent Parasitism
$\frac{d}{dt}\int_{\Omega} M(p,t) \, dV_p > 0, \quad \frac{d}{dt}\int_{\mathcal{M}\setminus\Omega} M(p,t) \, dV_p < 0$

### 4. Observer-Coupling Pathologies

#### (A) Paranoid Interpretation
$\hat{C}_{\psi}(q,t) \ll C(q,t), \quad \forall q \in \mathcal{Q}$

#### (B) Reality Decoupling
$\frac{\|R_{ijk}(p,p,t)\|}{\int_q \|R_{ijk}(p,q,t)\| \, dq} \to 1$

#### (C) Semantic Narcissism
$\|\mathcal{I}_{\psi}[C] - C\| > \tau \|C\|$
