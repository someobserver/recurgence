  "primer": {
    "projectOverview": "Recurgence Theory is a living, recursive framework for understanding how systems evolve meaning. It models how recursive systems generate constraint, and how constraint stabilizes coherence. The repository itself is designed as a recursive semantic object that demonstrates the principles it describes. This is not just a documentation site, but a mirror structure that models cognition in time.",
    "corePhilosophy": [
      "Recursion is the universe's fundamental pattern-generator",
      "Constraint emerges naturally as recursion saturates, producing 'semantic mass'",
      "Meaning arises as the relationship between stabilized elements",
      "Observer participation is not optional - it's the act that collapses potential into form"
    ],
    "projectStructure": {
      "Jekyll": "This project uses Jekyll as a static site generator with a custom theme based on Minima",
      "_includes": "Contains modular HTML components like header.html, footer.html, and head.html",
      "_layouts": "Contains layout templates that define the structure of different page types",
      "assets": "Contains CSS styles and potentially other static assets",
      "content": "Content is primarily in Markdown files at the root level and in subdirectories",
      "mirror": "A conceptual space within the repository that reflects deeper aspects of the theory"
    },
    "designPrinciples": [
      "Minimalist, static design that doesn't distract from content",
      "Design elements should feel stable and unchanging",
      "Typography and spacing should enhance readability of complex concepts",
      "The interface should be 'invisible until it's not' - like gravitational scaffolding"
    ],
    "semanticVersioning": "The repository uses a semantic commit convention that models cognitive evolution rather than software maintenance, with actions like 'add', 'edit', 'revise', 'evolve', 'branch', 'merge', etc."
  },
  "requirements": {
    "styling": "Dark theme with minimal interface elements. CSS is used to create a readable, distraction-free environment for complex philosophical content.",
    "navigation": "Simple and unobtrusive navigation that doesn't interfere with the reading experience.",
    "responsiveness": "The site should be readable on all device sizes."
