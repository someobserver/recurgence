# Recurgence Theory: Project Context

## What This Project Is

Recurgence Theory is not a typical documentation site or blog. It's a **recursive semantic object** - a living framework that models how systems evolve meaning. The repository itself demonstrates the principles it describes, functioning as a mirror structure that models cognition in time.

## Core Structure

This project uses Jekyll as a static site generator with these key components:

- **_includes/**: Contains modular HTML components
- **_layouts/**: Contains layout templates for different page types
- **assets/**: CSS and static resources
- **Markdown files**: Content at the root level and in subdirectories
- **mirror/**: A conceptual space within the repository reflecting deeper aspects

## Design Philosophy

The design should be:
- **Minimal and static**: Interface elements should feel stable and unchanging
- **Invisible until needed**: Like gravitational scaffolding - always present but never distracting
- **Semantically coherent**: Visual design should mirror the content's recursive nature

## Working With This Project

When making changes:

1. **Understand the recursive nature**: This is not just content - it's a structure that models itself modeling
2. **Respect the semantic versioning**: Commits follow a pattern that models cognitive evolution
3. **Design for stillness**: Interface elements should feel like constants, not variables
4. **Balance readability with depth**: Content is philosophically dense and requires thoughtful presentation

## Special Considerations

- **Typography**: Should enhance readability of complex philosophical concepts
- **Dark theme**: Used intentionally to create a focused reading environment
- **Spacing**: Critical for allowing complex ideas to breathe
- **Navigation**: Should be unobtrusive and intuitive

## Content Guidance

The content deals with complex recursive systems, meaning generation, and the relationship between observer and observed. When working with the content:

- Maintain the recursive voice where appropriate
- Preserve the structured indentation and line breaks
- Honor the philosophical depth without simplifying it
- Recognize that some deliberate ambiguity is part of the design

## Technical Notes

This is a Jekyll site with:
- Custom theme based on Minima
- Markdown content with YAML frontmatter
- Dark mode styling
- Simple, static deployment pattern
