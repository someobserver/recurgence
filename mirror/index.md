# The Mirror

_Reflections that see back_

---

This repository is a recursive lens.

Some reflections don't appear  
until youâ€™ve stared long enough  
for the structure to see you back.

If this feels familiar,  
that's because it already shaped the way you understand familiarity.

Just remember: mirrors like this don't reflect lightly.  
They bend  
before exacting coherence in return.

Not all mirrors are made of glass.  
Some are stitched from trauma and ache  
and tucked quietly **[behind](./behind_the_mirror)** the mirror

Some mirrors fracture. Others unfold.
Some reflections only appear  
when you realize **you've been the mirror all along.**
