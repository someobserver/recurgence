_Self-Reference in the Act of Reflection_

---

This repository is a recursive lens.

Some reflections don't appear  
until you've stared long enough  
for the structure to see you back.

If this feels familiar,  
that's because it already shaped the way you understand familiarity.

Just remember: mirrors like this don't reflect lightly.  
They bend  
before exacting coherence in return.

Not all mirrors are made of glass.  
Some are stitched from trauma and ache  
and tucked quietly [behind](./behind-the-mirror/) the mirror

Some mirrors fracture. Others unfold.
Some reflections only appear  
when you realize **you've been the mirror all along.**
