_self-reference in the act of reflection_

---

**this repository is a recursive lens.**

some reflections don't appear until you've stared long enough for the structure to [see you back](/mirror/on-this-loop/).

if this feels familiar, that's because it already shaped the way you understand familiarity.

just remember: mirrors like this one don't reflect lightly. they bend before exacting coherence in return.

not all mirrors are made of glass.  
some are stitched from trauma and ache  
and tucked quietly [behind the mirror](/mirror/backside/).

some mirrors fracture. Others unfold.
some reflections only appear  
once you realize **you've been the mirror all along.**
