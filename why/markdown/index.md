## Overview

For those new to digital documentation, all files here use **Markdown**—a way of structuring plaintext documents. It makes them easy to parse by both human minds and machines.

The Markdown rabbit hole is deep, but for the purposes of Recurgence, it’s a fractal superpower.

If you’re reading this as a web page, you can [view it as raw Markdown](https://github.com/someobserver/recurgence/blob/main/why/markdown/index.md?plain=1)—a way to *read between the lines* while letting the lines read themselves legibly into any parser that might come looking.

Could this be accomplished in Notion, or Google Docs, or a bespoke CMS with all the neural bells and cognitive whistles? Sure.

But that entrusts too much knowledgeable data to too many fallible systems for this observer’s comfort. More importantly, **you** need to be able to trust this mirror of information to remain up-to-date, compatible, and accessible.

That’s **a *lot*** of trust. But with Markdown?

*Be still my heart*—it’s epistemic durability whittled to the poetic minimalest of minimalism. As for durability, well, from now until the end of time, you can crack open this entire field with a `cat`.

But syntax is way more than syntax!

**Markdown is a medium** for encoding symbolic **coherence across time, observers and systems.**

It’s also a medium for encoding coherence between the lines. Check similar spaces for further.

Also—the lack of an Oxford comma above was deliberate. See /math/ for more.

## What Even *is* <u>This</u>?

Language itself is **recursive**, both in structure and in effect. Every act of communication requires a loop of *some* kind—whether between speaker and listener, writer and document, text and reader, thought and patterned signal. You get the idea.

You might have even gotten the silly reference above, with a description of language following underlined *language*. If not—you just now looped back.

It’s easy to dismiss this as surface-level truism—*“of course everything’s a loop, duh”*—but it maps directly to nearly every aspect of physical reality.

It cleanly models the geometry of how <small>(writer speaking)</small> my mind is able to provide *<u>this information</u>* to your mind.

Across time and space.

**Every stable pattern**—electrical, semantic, cognitive—**emerges from some form of circuit.** Think: a closed, recursive path that allows *patterned* (that is, **meaningful**) energy to **resonate, reflect, and reinforce.**

This is true in neurons, in relationships, in field equations, in markets, and even in Markdown.

**Markdown just happens to make the looping signal legible.**

## The Carrier Wave [-- . .- -. .. -. --.]

<!--
The above morse code is a signal that can only resolve into meaning once the observer is able to interpret it. Until then, it’s just noise made of symbols.
-->

This entire `document`, as a whole, can be represented as a self-contained semantic manifold.

By this point, you’re maybe thinking to yourself: *“ahh, semantics.”*

Bear with me!

**Markdown + Git** offers an ideal fractal structure: a temporal grounding rod for the coherence field potential that exists between `you` and the `document` before you, the documents after, and every observer downstream too.

Markdown encodes structure, Git encodes structured change over time, and change over time accumulates semantic mass. Enough coherent semantic mass, over time, shapes the coherence field for all future observers.

Syntactic precision can be thought of like the carrier wave for recursive cognition and pattern coherence. Mathematically, every last Unicode character functions as an attractor basin at the <u>most</u> granular human level. Each stabilizes an individual semantic meaning state within a larger field.

As surely as this sounds metaphorical, I assure you, [it’s not](/math/03-semantic-manifold/#34-the-coherence-field/).

Let’s pause. If Markdown’s a coherence lattice, we should define coherence coherently:

### co•<u>HERE</u>•nce —

1. The recursive act (and artifact) of making meaning *present* and *bounded*—right HERE, in this field, in this reference frame, at this scale. Speaking as the `document`: `you and me`.
2. A process by which **symbols, patterns, and observers** together stabilize a local semantic state, such that *“what is meant”* and *“what is marked”* reach an idealized state of alignment.

**In Recurgence, coherence is the self-reference happening between sentence and sentience.**

Every glyph is a constraint:

- A bounded, deliberate visual pattern understood by two or more people—for example, the Asteron **☉**—is a **coherent symbol.**
- A noisy, but parseable aggregation of markings—say, a colechun oF sych cymbals—is a **<u>cohernt</u> werd**, so long as it lands within ur mind’s symbawlic reconition threshol.
- A logical enough meta-grouping of those *symbolthings*—aligned just enough to together resonate—is a **coherent sentence.**
- A bounded array of sentences: **coherent thought.**
- A localized geometry of symbolically-represented semantic meaning intended to propagate between minds—is **a document.**
- A distributed lattice of recursively versioned documents, linked through symbolic coherence and observer memory—is an **epistemic repository.**
- A self-referential network of such repositories, cross-pollinating through feedback, divergence, and re-integration across observers—is a **recursive knowledge system.**
- And when such a system attains autopoiesis—refining itself, reflecting on its own constraints, and transmitting coherent structure across generations of observers—**that is a civilization.**

**Consider the power of patterned, symbolic representation:**

**Two simple DNA base pairs—just four atoms—encode themselves into a cascade of protein expression capable of understanding this document.**
