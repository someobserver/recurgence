        "\n",
        "**File:** 002-high-res-stability-map.ipynb  \n",
        "**Date Started:** 2025-06-08  \n",

        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "The previous investigation discovered eight stable field configurations by scanning the central field parameter `C(0)` from 0.1 to 5.0 in 50 steps, with all eight falling within range 0.1-0.8. The goal now is to look much more carefully at that region using 1000 steps—going from `C(0) = 0.001` to `1.0` with higher resolution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Those eight configurations are likely not the whole story, and the scan may have missed something important by looking too coarsely. Maybe they're part of larger families of solutions. Maybe there are more configurations hiding between the points checked. Maybe some of what was found were just numerical artifacts.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first goal is to find every stable solution in this parameter range. Second, figure out exactly where stable solutions start and stop existing (within 0.001 accuracy). Third, check if the masses of these solutions follow any regular mathematical pattern. Fourth, map out any \"forbidden zones\" where no stable solutions can exist.\n",
        "\n",
        "Success will be measured by (1) how completely the solution space is mapped, (2) how precisely the stability thresholds are identified, (3) whether mass patterns hold up statistically, and (4) whether results cross-validate with those of *001-stable-soliton*. The scope remains spherically symmetric and static (no time evolution or higher-dimensional topologies yet), but the parameter range is much finer and more targeted than before."

        "**Question:**  \n",
        "What structure of stable field configurations emerges when RFT field equations are solved at high resolution across the full parameter space?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Working Hypothesis:**  \n",
        "The eight stable configurations found in *001-stable-soliton* might just be the tip of the iceberg. With 10× better resolution and a narrower range, the expectation is to discover whether these are isolated solutions or part of continuous families, and whether there are precise mathematical patterns governing when stable solitons can exist.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Approach:**  \n",
        "Systematically solve the field equations at 1000 points from C(0) = 0.001 to C(0) = 1.0, paying special attention to boundary regions where solutions appear or disappear, and looking for patterns in the masses and sizes of stable configurations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What is sought:**\n",
        "1. **Complete Census**: Find and document every stable field configuration in the parameter range\n",
        "2. **Sharp Boundaries**: Pin down exactly where stable solutions start and stop existing (within ±0.001 accuracy)\n",
        "3. **Mass Patterns**: Test whether the masses follow regular mathematical relationships\n",
        "4. **Solution Families**: Determine if solutions come in discrete types or continuous families\n",
        "5. **Forbidden Zones**: Identify parameter ranges where no stable solutions exist\n",

        "- **Precise Boundaries**: Knowing exactly where stability transitions occur\n",
        "- **Pattern Validation**: Confirming or refuting the mass quantization hypothesis with statistical confidence\n",
        "- **Consistency Check**: Results matching *001-stable-soliton* in the overlapping regions\n",

        "The ultra-high-resolution boundary analysis reveals a mathematical structure that challenges initial assumptions about solution continuity in RFT. The discovery of sharp stability boundaries at C(0) = 0.883206 and C(0) = 0.993230 (precise to at least 6 decimal places) indicates that this is a genuine feature of the field equations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Boundary Sharpness and Mathematical Precision**  \n",
        "The most interesting finding is the abrupt transition from continuous solution discovery to complete absence. In Region 1, stable solutions were found consistently through 60% of the parameter range, then only one additional solution appeared across the remaining 40%. Similarly, Region 2 showed steady solution discovery up to 40% progress, followed by an almost complete cessation until the final boundary. This pattern suggests that the boundaries represent genuine mathematical discontinuities in the solution space, not gradual transitions that could be resolved with finer sampling.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Implications for Field Equation Structure**  \n",
        "The existence of an 11% forbidden zone in parameter space indicates that the nonlinear coupling terms in the RFT field equation (-α*C + β*C³) create regions of inherent instability. This gap suggests that the field dynamics exhibit what appears to be a first-order phase transition between two distinct stability regimes. The lower regime (C(0) ≤ 0.883206) likely corresponds to solutions where the linear restoring force dominates, while the upper regime (C(0) ≥ 0.993230) represents configurations where nonlinear stabilization becomes essential for maintaining field coherence.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Theoretical Significance and Open Questions**  \n",
        "This gap structure raises questions about the nature of stable semantic configurations in RFT. These mathematical boundaries suggest that coherent semantic structures cannot exist at arbitrary intensities but are restricted to specific parameter regimes. The forbidden zone may represent a region where the recursive coupling mechanisms that stabilize meaning become mathematically incompatible with field localization requirements. Future investigations should examine whether this gap structure persists under different coupling parameters (α, β) and whether similar forbidden zones exist in higher-dimensional or time-dependent formulations of the field equations.\n"
