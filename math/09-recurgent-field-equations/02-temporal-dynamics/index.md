## Overview

This section formalizes the **bidirectional temporal flow** intrinsic to Recurgent Field Theory (RFT), establishing the dual propagation of causality and information within the semantic manifold. Outward causal emission from semantic mass concentrations and inward information reception via constraint density jointly generate the phenomenological experience of time and modulate recursive dynamics.

Key mathematical structures:
1. **Causal Emission Field** $\vec{E}_c(p,t)$ — outward propagation of causal influence from semantic mass.
2. **Information Reception Field** $\vec{I}_r(p,t)$ — inward flow of semantic signals modulated by constraint density and wisdom gradient.
3. **Temporal Asymmetry Operator** $\mathcal{T}(p,t)$ — quantifies local alignment of causal and informational flows.
4. **Conservation Law** — relates divergence of causal emission to the time derivative of information density.
5. **Recursive Temporal Lens Effect** — describes temporal curvature induced by semantic mass and recursive coupling.
6. **Modified Coherence Evolution Equation** — incorporates bidirectional temporal flow into the dynamics of coherence.

This bidirectional structure underpins the recursive feedback between meaning propagation and semantic integration, enabling RFT to model temporal phenomena such as dilation, contraction, and the emergence of recursive attractors within a unified geometric framework.

### **9.6 Bidirectional Temporal Flow**

Recurgent Field Theory posits a fundamental temporal asymmetry within the semantic manifold, characterized by the dual propagation of causality and information. Specifically, causal influence emanates outward from loci of semantic mass, while informational signals are received inward, modulated by constraint density and the wisdom gradient. This bidirectional structure underlies the phenomenology of temporality and governs the recursive evolution of meaning.

#### **9.6.1 Formal Structure**

Let $\mathcal{M}$ denote the semantic manifold. Define two vector fields:

1. **Causal Emission Field** $\vec{E}_c(p,t)$:
\[
\vec{E}_c(p,t) = \gamma_c\, M(p,t)\, \nabla\Phi(p,t)
\]
where
- $\gamma_c$ is the causal coupling constant,
- $M(p,t)$ is the semantic mass density,
- $\nabla\Phi(p,t)$ is the gradient of the recursive potential.

2. **Information Reception Field** $\vec{I}_r(p,t)$:
\[
\vec{I}_r(p,t) = -\gamma_i\, \rho(p,t)\, \nabla W(p,t)
\]
where
- $\gamma_i$ is the information coupling constant,
- $\rho(p,t)$ is the constraint density,
- $\nabla W(p,t)$ is the gradient of the wisdom field.

The interaction of these fields is quantified by the **temporal asymmetry operator**:
\[
\mathcal{T}(p,t) = \vec{E}_c(p,t) \cdot \vec{I}_r(p,t)
\]
which measures the local alignment between causal emission and information reception at each point $(p,t) \in \mathcal{M}$.

#### **9.6.2 Conservation Principle**

The bidirectional temporal flow is governed by a conservation law:
\[
\nabla \cdot \vec{E}_c(p,t) + \frac{\partial}{\partial t} I_d(p,t) = 0
\]
where $I_d(p,t) = \|\vec{I}_r(p,t)\|$ denotes the information density.

This relation asserts that the divergence of causal emission is balanced by the negative temporal rate of change of information density, establishing a semantic analogue to the continuity equations of classical field theory.

#### **9.6.3 Recursive Temporal Curvature**

In regions of elevated semantic mass—such as at recursive attractors—the interplay of bidirectional flows induces a **recursive temporal lens** effect, formalized by the temporal curvature coefficient:
\[
\kappa_t(p) = \frac{\|\vec{E}_c(p,t)\|}{\|\vec{I}_r(p,t)\|} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + \lambda\, \|R_{ijk}(p,p,t)\|_F}
\]
where
- $\kappa_t(p)$ quantifies the local curvature of temporal flow,
- $\lambda$ is a damping parameter,
- $\|R_{ijk}(p,p,t)\|_F$ is the Frobenius norm of the self-recursive coupling tensor.

Interpretation:
- $\kappa_t(p) \gg 1$ indicates dominance of causal emission, corresponding to temporal dilation.
- $\kappa_t(p) \ll 1$ indicates dominance of information reception, corresponding to temporal contraction.

#### **9.6.4 Modification of Coherence Dynamics**

The bidirectional temporal structure modifies the evolution of the coherence field $C_i(p,t)$ as follows:
\[
\frac{\partial C_i(p,t)}{\partial t} = \Box C_i + T_{ij}^{\mathrm{rec}}\, g^{jk} C_k + \xi\, (\vec{E}_c \times \vec{I}_r)_i
\]
where $\Box$ is the d'Alembertian (or appropriate Laplacian) operator, $T_{ij}^{\mathrm{rec}}$ encodes recursive coupling, $g^{jk}$ is the inverse metric, and $\xi$ is a coupling constant.

The cross product term $(\vec{E}_c \times \vec{I}_r)_i$ is defined according to the dimension $n$ of the manifold:
- For $n=3$, the standard vector cross product applies.
- For $n \neq 3$, employ the antisymmetric tensor:
  \[
  (\vec{E}_c \times \vec{I}_r)_i = \omega_{ijk} E_c^j I_r^k
  \]
  where $\omega_{ijk}$ is the orientation tensor.
- In a fully coordinate-free, dimension-agnostic formulation:
  \[
  (\vec{E}_c \times \vec{I}_r)_i = \left(\star(E_c^\flat \wedge I_r^\flat)\right)^\sharp_i
  \]
  where $\star$ is the Hodge star, $\wedge$ the exterior product, and $\flat$, $\sharp$ denote musical isomorphisms.

This construction ensures the bidirectional temporal flow is rigorously defined for arbitrary manifold dimension and structure.
