## Overview

This section presents the **core field equations** governing the global evolution of the coherence field $C(p, t)$ on the semantic manifold $\mathcal{M}$. Building on the constructs of semantic mass, recursive tensors, autopoietic ignition, and regulatory dynamics, these equations formalize the propagation, deformation, and stabilization of meaning within Recurgent Field Theory (RFT).

Key mathematical structures:
1. **Recurgent Field Equation** — describes the dynamics of coherence propagation under recursive stress.
2. **Semantic Geodesics** — define the natural trajectories of meaning shaped by manifold curvature.
3. **Metric Evolution Equation** — captures the feedback loop by which recursion reshapes semantic geometry.

Together, these equations constitute a closed dynamical system for recursive cognition and meaning emergence, integrating local field interactions with global geometric evolution.

### 9.2 Recurgent Field Equation

The evolution of the coherence field $C_i(p, t)$ under recursive stress is governed by the recurgent field equation:
$$
\Box C_i = T^{\text{rec}}_{ij} \, g^{jk} C_k
$$
where
- $\Box = \nabla^a \nabla_a$ denotes the covariant d'Alembertian operator on the semantic manifold $\mathcal{M}$,
- $T^{\text{rec}}_{ij}$ is the recursive stress-energy tensor (see Section 2.3),
- $g^{jk}$ is the inverse metric tensor.

Interpretation:

This equation formalizes the principle that the acceleration of coherence, both spatially and temporally, is determined by the local recursive stress and the geometry of semantic constraints. In regions of elevated semantic mass or pronounced recursive torsion, the coherence field is subject to curvature and may collapse into attractor basins. Conversely, in regions of low density, coherence propagates diffusively.

### 9.3 Semantic Geodesics

The natural trajectory of a semantic point $p \in \mathcal{M}$ under recursive evolution is described by the geodesic equation:
$$
\frac{d^2 p^i}{ds^2} + \Gamma^i_{jk} \frac{dp^j}{ds} \frac{dp^k}{ds} = 0
$$
where
- $s$ is a parameter along the curve (e.g., time or recursive depth),
- $\Gamma^i_{jk}$ are the Christoffel symbols associated with the metric $g_{ij}$,
- $p^i(s)$ are the coordinates of the evolving semantic state.

Interpretation:  

Geodesics represent the extremal (least-resistance) paths of recursive transformation on the manifold. The curvature encoded by $\Gamma^i_{jk}$ deforms these paths, resulting in the emergence of semantic attractors. Thus, the geodesic structure determines the spontaneous alignment of evolving meaning with established semantic trajectories.

### 9.4 Metric Evolution

The geometry of the semantic manifold is itself dynamic, evolving in response to recursive flows and the accumulation of semantic mass. The evolution of the metric tensor is given by:
$$
\frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial t} = -2 R_{ij} + F_{ij}(R, D, A)
$$
where
- $R_{ij}$ is the Ricci curvature tensor, encoding the torsion induced by recursion,
- $F_{ij}$ is a forcing term dependent on the recursive coupling $R$, recursive depth $D$, and attractor stability $A$.

Implication:  

Recursive processes induce curvature in the semantic geometry, which in turn modulates subsequent recursive flows. This establishes a closed feedback system in which the manifold's structure is continuously reshaped by, and in turn shapes, the propagation of coherence.

The interdependence of the primary fields and their governing equations can be schematically represented as follows:
