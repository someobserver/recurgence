### Overview

This appendix addresses the foundational mathematical consistency requirements underlying Recurgent Field Theory (RFT). It clarifies tensor conventions, resolves technical subtleties, and provides formal checks necessary for both theoretical integrity and computational implementation.

Key elements:
1. **Consistency Checks** — verification of dimensional, notational, and algebraic coherence across all field equations and operators.
2. **Notational Conventions** — explicit definitions of index usage, summation conventions, and tensor symmetries.
3. **Boundary and Edge Cases** — treatment of singularities, degenerate configurations, and limiting behaviors.
4. **Implementation Notes** — guidance for discretization, numerical stability, and translation to computational architectures.

This appendix functions as a reference for both theoretical development and practical realization, supporting the mathematical robustness and operational soundness of all RFT components.

### **A.1 Dual Character of the Recursive Coupling Tensor**

The recursive coupling tensor $R_{ijk}(p, q, t)$ exhibits a dual mathematical character:

1. **Operational Definition:** As a second derivative of the coherence field,
   $$
   R_{ijk}(p, q, t) = \frac{\partial^2 C_k(p, t)}{\partial \psi_i(p) \partial \psi_j(q)}
   $$
2. **Dynamical Evolution:** As a field evolving according to
   $$
   \frac{dR_{ijk}(p, q, t)}{dt} = \Phi(C_{\mathrm{mag}}(p, t)) \cdot \chi_{ijk}(p, q, t)
   $$

For the theory to remain coherent, these two perspectives must be brought into alignment. The compatibility condition reads:
$$
\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial^2 C_k(p, t)}{\partial \psi_i(p) \partial \psi_j(q)}\right) = \Phi(C_{\mathrm{mag}}(p, t)) \cdot \chi_{ijk}(p, q, t)
$$

This requirement places nontrivial constraints on the dynamics of the underlying fields $\psi_i$. In particular, it may call for additional terms in the evolution equations for $\psi_i$, and may depend on a separation of timescales between rapid field adjustments and slower structural evolution. The precise analytic mechanism by which this compatibility is realized remains an open subject of investigation.

### **A.2 Conservation of the Recursive Stress-Energy Tensor**

The recurgent Einstein equation is only well-posed if the recursive stress-energy tensor is divergence-free:
$$
\nabla_j T^{\mathrm{rec}}_{ij} = 0
$$

Several approaches can be used to establish this conservation law:

1. **Lagrangian Formalism:** If $T^{\mathrm{rec}}_{ij}$ is derived from a matter Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}_M$ for the semantic field,
   $$
   T^{\mathrm{rec}}_{ij} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{-g}} \frac{\delta \mathcal{L}_M}{\delta g^{ij}}
   $$
   then, as long as the field equations hold, Noether’s theorem (diffeomorphism invariance) yields conservation.

2. **Modified Field Equations:** If non-conserved components appear, the field equations can be supplemented with correction terms to preserve the Bianchi identities and maintain internal consistency.

3. **Constraint Enforcement in Simulation:** In computational settings, constraint forces (e.g., via Lagrange multipliers) may be introduced to maintain conservation numerically.

A full mathematical demonstration of these mechanisms remains a focus of ongoing theoretical work.
