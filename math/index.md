### **Abstract**

**Recurgent Field Theory (RFT)** proposes **recur**sion as the engine of emer**gence**—driving phase transitions, bifurcations, and the genesis of semantic domains through geometric field dynamics.

Meaning emerges as a recursive, generative field on a differentiable manifold $\mathcal{M}$ whose points encode semantic configurations and whose geometry is shaped by attractors, constraints, and cycles of creative recursion. 

The theory is built axiomatically from eleven core axioms, formalizing how coherence flows, recursive coupling tensors, and semantic mass fields characterize the local and global dynamics of meaning. Conservation laws, variational principles, and symmetry constraints are adapted from physics to describe the propagation and stabilization of semantic structure.

RFT introduces field-theoretic analogs of humility and wisdom to regulate unchecked recursion, while the interplay between coherence and recursive structure exhibits an uncertainty principle that enables semantic systems to remain both resilient and fertile.

Agents arise as bounded, self-referential submanifolds—regions capable of interpretation, self-modification, and communication. The theory provides a mathematically explicit account of observer-dependence, collective meaning-making, and the dynamics of epistemic pathologies and healing.
